👋 Hi, I’m Tiffany Nguyen

👀 I’m interested in the intersection of finance and technology, exploring data-driven insights, and leveraging Python and R for quantitative analysis.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced statistical modeling techniques and deepening my knowledge in financial data analytics.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to quantitative finance, data science, and building innovative financial applications.
